# How to install:

obviously you need to have python installed but then do these commands if you didnt already have them installed


```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
```

# How to use:

**ONLY .JPG FILES!**

put images into the images file (dont have to be resized) as the next number in the folder so like now the highest file is 5.jpg so now you rename your file to (that you put in) 6.jpg

It can for now only recognize: planes, cars, birds, cats, deers, dogs, frogs, horses, ships and trucks
